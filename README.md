repo of utilities I've made

dec2hex - literally converts a decimal number to a hex number, because I was lazy and didn't feel like doing math.

pngdcd - utility that decodes png images and returns information about its chunks, revealing data that might be hidden within.

hash - decodes or encondes something based on md5 hash, I really don't remember what it does.

pdbstl - generates an stl file for a 3D printer from a PDB file from the protient database

scadr - generates a scad file of a specified shape and scale

stler - generates a stl file for a 3D printer of specfied shape and its scale.
